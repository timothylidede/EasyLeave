# Easy Leave

A Java Desktop Application that allows employees to login and apply for leave applications, view remaining leave days and make enquiries to their managers.
Line Managers in turn also have the ability to login and view all applications made by their employees depending on their departnments. They also have the ability to accept or decline these requests. They also have the ability to award bonus days and view employee's enquiries.
